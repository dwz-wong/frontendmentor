What I have learned from this project or challenge is how to install and how to use the CSS framework [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Not only that, but it also helps me to improve my HTML & CSS skills as well.

### Continued development

I'm still not completely comfortable using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) since I'm a beginner, but I will continue to challenge Frontend Mentor projects using the CSS framework [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to refine my front-end skills for future projects.
